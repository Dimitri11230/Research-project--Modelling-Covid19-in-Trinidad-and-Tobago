# Research-project--Modelling-Covid19-in-Trinidad-and-Tobago
Fitting the second wave of covid-19 to the SIR model for Trinidad and Tobago. Analysis of the model and its predictions. This is a Python based project built in Google Colab and uses Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib. This was my semester project for Ordinary Differential Equations, overseen by Prof. Edwin Gerber. The report and analysis (ie the Word Document will not be included but all of the code used is here!) The plots are pretty and this project combined my love for math and coding! The analysis was even more beautiful and I will publish that part when I am satisfied with it. But see the ipynb files! Also, the data needed to run this in Colab is called actualdraft2.txt. So upload it to the files in Colab if you want to rerun the python notebooks.
